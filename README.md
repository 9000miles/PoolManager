# ðŸ”„ Pool Manager

The Pool Manager helps reuse objects that show up often, instead of creating and destroying them each time.

Creating and destroying objects, like projectiles or explosions, can be slow and cause issues such as making the game slow or laggy when done frequently.

The Pool Manager alleviates these problems by maintaining a pool of objects. Instead of creating and destroying objects all the time, the Pool Manager keeps these objects for reuse. This strategy improves the smoothness of the game.
